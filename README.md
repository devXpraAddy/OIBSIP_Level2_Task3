# OIBSIP_Level2_Task3

In this task we have to create a to-do web app that allows users to add, edit,
and delete daily tasks. The app must have separate lists for completed
and pending tasks, and users must be able to mark tasks as complete.
Additionally i have added a relaxing music feature to it.
